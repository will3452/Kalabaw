        The Vigan City Agricultural Office has a hard time keeping track of information on farmers and fishers since they still collect and store data in the traditional format.  Owing to the existence of a pandemic in the country, providing help to farmers and fishers has become nearly impossible due to various health standards that the government is implementing.  Vfarm is a web system that can keep information on farmers and fishers as well as the raw materials used in various assistance programs offered by Vigan City Agricultural Office.

        The system features farmer and fisher profiles for agriculturists to review, as well as a geotagging tool to locate these farmers and fishers. Furthermore, the system contains crop-related recommendations for farmers.
